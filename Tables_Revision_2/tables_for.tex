Lorelei Salas (Commissioner of NYC Dept. of Consumer and Worker Protection)  & New York City, NY & Fast food and retail workers endure unpredictable schedules and incomes
that make it hard for them to create budgets, schedule child care,
or pursue education or a second job. \tabularnewline
\hline 
Massachusetts Fair Workweek Law Initiative & Massachusetts & {[}FWLs{]} allows workers in restaurants, retail establishments, and
the hospitality industry the chance to build stable lives for themselves
and their families, because for many, erratic work schedules make
stability almost impossible. \tabularnewline

Paul Koretz 

(Council member)  & Los Angeles, CA & It is a minor inconvenience for employers to provide a stable workweek.
But it makes a life-and-death difference for workers who have an unreliable
schedule that changes from week to week. \\

Its passage is one of the proudest moments of the L.A. City Council.
It makes a lot of things in life possible and functional without causing
an undue harm to the employers \tabularnewline

Curren Price

(Council member)  & Los Angeles, CA & These new regulations will provide employees -- many of whom are
people of color and live paycheck to paycheck -- predictability,
stability and flexibility in their work schedules, while demonstrating
respect and appreciation for them and their families. Besides being
the right thing to do, these protections will make it easier for Angelenos
to balance their family and work lives, and to plan ahead.\\

We must recognize the gaps and wide range of concerns faced by our
workers, and we must put their needs over corporate profits. This
is the least we can do to give them our sincere appreciation and thanks
for the work that they do. \tabularnewline

going to be operating in our city. \tabularnewline

Helen Xu 

(Reporter covering Colorado\textquoteright s Fair Workweek Law  & Colorado & Emotional testimony from supporters described how unpredictable schedules
threw their lives into chaos, leaving them to constantly scramble
and stress about making child pickups and drop-offs, medically necessary
doctor's appointments, and important social events such as birthdays,
anniversaries and even weddings. Many cited studies showing that unpredictable
schedules and their negative effects fell disproportionately on women
and people of color, framing this bill as a small step toward fixing
systematic racism.\tabularnewline

Bob Reiter 

(Chicago Federation of Labor)  & Chicago, IL & At the end of the day, if you schedule your people fairly and you\textquoteright re
a good employer, the scheduling law just shouldn\textquoteright t
add any cost to your plate. \tabularnewline
